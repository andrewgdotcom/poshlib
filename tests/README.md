# Tests

The tests are grouped into a rough order so that each depends only on modules that have been tested earlier in the sequence.
The categories are:

## 000 - 009

Poshlib core functionality

## 010-099

Basic data structures and advanced flow control

## 100-199

Complex data structures and introspection

## 200-299

File handling and networking

# Testing

To test locally, run the individual test scripts or `all`.
To test on all supported script engines, run `multiver` with the tests to run (or `all`) as arguments.
